 I've implemented and tested the RAG Chatbot; here are the final integration steps:

  Setup:
   1. Environment Variables: Set OPENAI_API_KEY, QDRANT_URL, QDRANT_API_KEY, BOOK_RAG_DOCUSAURUS_URL, and optionally
      BOOK_RAG_TEST_DOCUSAURUS_URL in a backend/.env file or directly in your environment.
   2. Backend Dependencies: In backend/, run pip install -r requirements.txt (add qdrant-client if missing).
   3. Start Backend: In backend/, run python main.py (serves at http://localhost:8000).
   4. Start Frontend: In project root, npm install && npm start (serves Docusaurus at http://localhost:3000).

  Usage & Verification:
   1. Ingest Documents: On your Docusaurus site, open the chatbot and click the "Ingest Docusaurus Docs" button to
      populate the vector store.
   2. Test Chatbot: Ask questions using both "Entire Book" and "Selected Text" modes.
   3. Run Backend Tests: In backend/, execute python test_api.py.

  Deployment: Consider Qdrant persistence, API key security, and aligning BOOK_RAG_DOCUSAURUS_URL with your deployed
  Docusaurus site.

  This completes the task.
