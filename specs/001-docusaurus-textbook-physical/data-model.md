**Date**: 2025-12-06

## Entities

This project is a static website and does not have a traditional data model with a database. The "data" is the content, which is organized in a hierarchy of files and directories.

### 1. Textbook
- **Description**: The root of the content. It corresponds to the `docs` directory in the Docusaurus project.
- **Attributes**:
    - `title`: The title of the textbook (configured in `docusaurus.config.js`).
    - `sidebar`: The navigation structure for the textbook (configured in `sidebars.js` or autogenerated by Docusaurus).

### 2. Chapter
- **Description**: A logical grouping of related documents. It is represented by a subdirectory within the `docs` directory and a sidebar category.
- **Attributes**:
    - `title`: The name of the chapter (defined by the directory name or in the sidebar configuration).
    - `documents`: An ordered list of documents within the chapter.

### 3. Document
- **Description**: A single page of content, corresponding to a Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`).
- **Attributes**:
    - `id`: A unique identifier for the document (derived from the file path).
    - `title`: The title of the page (usually the first `<h1>` heading in the Markdown file).
    - `content`: The body of the document, written in Markdown.

## Relationships

- A **Textbook** has one or more **Chapters**.
- A **Chapter** has one or more **Documents**.

This content hierarchy is represented by the file system structure and Docusaurus configuration, not by a database schema.
