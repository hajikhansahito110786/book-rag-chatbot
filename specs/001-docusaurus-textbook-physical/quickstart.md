# Quickstart: Docusaurus Textbook

**Date**: 2025-12-06

This guide provides instructions for setting up the development environment and running the Docusaurus project.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher.
- **npm** or **Yarn**: Package manager for Node.js.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the local development server with live reloading:

```bash
npm run start
```
or
```bash
yarn start
```

This will open the website in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building the Static Site

To build the website for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn build
```

The static files will be generated in the `build` directory. This is the directory that will be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Content Workflow

1.  Add new Markdown files (`.md` or `.mdx`) to the `docs` directory.
2.  Update the sidebar navigation by editing `sidebars.js` if you are not using autogenerated sidebars.
3.  Commit your changes and create a pull request.
4.  Once the pull request is merged to the `main` branch, the changes will be automatically deployed to the live website.
