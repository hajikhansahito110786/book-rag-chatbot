# Feature Specification: Integrated RAG Chatbot

**Feature Branch**: `001-rag-chatbot-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "enhance existing project with Integrated RAG Chatbot"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Question Answering (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to ask the chatbot a question in natural language and receive a relevant, coherent answer based on the project's documentation. This allows me to find information quickly without manually searching through the documents.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the chatbot and provides the most immediate value to the user.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking a question that can be answered from a known set of documents and verifying the answer's relevance and accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the chatbot is loaded and a knowledge base is indexed, **When** a user asks a question like "What is the main purpose of this project?", **Then** the chatbot should provide a concise, relevant answer derived from the project's documentation.
2. **Given** the chatbot is loaded, **When** a user asks a question for which there is no relevant information in the knowledge base, **Then** the chatbot should respond with a message indicating it cannot answer the question, such as "I'm sorry, I don't have enough information to answer that question."

### User Story 2 - Displaying Sources (Priority: P2)

As a user, when I receive an answer from the chatbot, I want to see the sources of the information, so I can verify the answer and explore the context in more detail.

**Why this priority**: Providing sources builds trust and allows users to delve deeper into the documentation if they wish.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking a question and verifying that the response includes a list of source documents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has received an answer to a question, **When** the answer is displayed, **Then** a list of the source documents used to generate the answer should also be displayed.

### Edge Cases

- **No input**: What happens when the user submits an empty query? The chatbot should prompt the user to enter a question.
- **Ambiguous queries**: How does the system handle queries that could have multiple interpretations? The chatbot will provide a primary answer based on the most likely interpretation and suggest related questions to guide the user to other possible interpretations.
- **Large documents**: How does the system handle very large documents in the knowledge base? The system should be able to process and index them without significant performance degradation.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a user interface for users to input questions and view answers.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST be able to ingest and process a collection of documents to create a knowledge base.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to find relevant information in the knowledge base.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST generate a coherent, natural language answer based on the retrieved information.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST display the source documents for each generated answer.
- **FR-006**: The ingestion process for new documents MUST be event-driven (e.g., on every documentation update).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User Query**: The question asked by the user in natural language.
- **Document**: A single file or piece of text in the knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Base**: A collection of indexed documents used for retrieval.
- **Generated Answer**: The natural language response generated by the chatbot.
- **Source**: A reference to a document used to generate an answer.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: At least 80% of answers provided by the chatbot for a sample set of questions are rated as "relevant" and "accurate" by a human evaluator.
- **SC-002**: The average time to receive an answer from the chatbot is less than 5 seconds.
- **SC-003**: User satisfaction, measured by a simple "was this helpful?" poll after each answer, is above 75% positive.
- **SC-004**: There is a 20% reduction in users navigating to the manual search page, indicating they are finding answers through the chatbot.

## Assumptions

- A corpus of documentation exists and is available for ingestion.
- The documentation is in a format that can be parsed (e.g., Markdown, plain text).
