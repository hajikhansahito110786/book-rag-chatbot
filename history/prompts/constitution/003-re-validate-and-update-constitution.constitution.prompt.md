## Response snapshot

I have updated the constitution file to version 1.0.1 and updated the last amended date. I also verified that all dependent templates are in sync.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The constitution was updated to version 1.0.1.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: The initial instructions for finding the phr script were incorrect for the current environment. I was able to adapt by using the agent-native flow.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Incorrect path for phr script.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Verify paths before executing shell commands.
